Aletheia is a cheating detector for hackathons. The eventual goal is
to cover the various forms of cheating, such as:

- Starting a project before the hackathon
- Plagiarized code
- Teams larger than the max size
- Contributors to multiple repos


In addition, Aletheia may discover some other useful facts such as:

- Usage of persistence
- Hard coding data
